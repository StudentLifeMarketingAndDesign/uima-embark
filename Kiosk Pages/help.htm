You may search the UIMA Online Collections in three different ways.                <h3>1. Quick Search</h3>                The Quick Search box is displayed at the top of the left menu bar.  Simply enter one or more words in the box, then click the <strong>Go</strong> button.  If a match is found, the results will be displayed as a list of thumbnails with short captions; if no results are found, a message is displayed to "Try again."                <br>                <i>TIP: Enter the beginning of a search word to retrieve more results, e.g. "Lib" instead of "Library".</i>                <h3>2. Advanced Search</h3>                This search enables you to search multiple fields at once using AND/OR operators.                 The first popup on the page contains a list of searchable fields. After selecting the field you want to search in the first drop-down, a set of search values will be displayed in a second drop-down list. Select the search value from this popup.                <br><br>                Boolean operators "and", "or" may be used.  All objects that meet your search criteria will be included in your search results.  See also: <a href="#advanced">Advanced Search Options</a>.                    <a name="artist"></a>                <h3>3. Artist Biographical Search</h3>                This search enables you to search on up to six fields of information directly related biographical information about the makers of the works in the database.                <br><br>                The first popup on the page contains a list of searchable fields. After selecting the field you want to search in the first drop-down, a set of search values will be displayed in a second drop-down list. Select the search value from this list.                <br><br>                If a field contains too many values to include in the picklist, the list will be broken down by starting letters/numbers such as "A", "B", etc. When you select a letter, a new window will open with the values that begin with that letter. Select a value to close that window and complete your search criteria. See also: <a href="#advanced">Advanced Search Options</a>.                <br><br>                Click Add Line to add a second line to the search. Boolean operators "and", "or", and "except" may be used.  All objects that meet your search criteria will be included in your search results.

Each line can be joined to the other with an AND, OR or EXCEPT, and each line will be executed in the order in which you list it.</li>                <li>If you use multiple lines in your search, be aware that an AND or EXCEPT search will limit your search results; you will get fewer records than if you did a single line search. On the other hand, an OR search will likely increase the number of records that you find.</li>                </ul>                         <a name="advanced"></a>                <h3>Advanced Options</h3>                The Advanced Search and the Artist Biographical Search may be used to refine any selection of object records made active through a previous search or portfolio.                <ul>                <li>To expand the number of records in your selection, choose "Add to Selection."</li>                <li>To search only within the active selection, choose "Search Only Current Selection."</li>                <li>To ignore records found in previous searches, choose "New Selection."</li>                </ul>                <hr>                <a name="Multiple"></a>                <h2>Multiple Record Display</h2>                The multiple record view is used to display the contents of a Portfolio, the results of a <a href="#Search">Search</a>, or the objects linked to an <a href="#artist">Artist</a>.                <br>                The default display view is <strong>image & label</strong>.

The Text Only view will display up to 25 records at once.  Each of the underlined column headers may be clicked to sort the selection of records by that criteria (e.g., by Artist name, Date, or Medium).  If text in the list of records is underlined (or in a different color), it can be clicked to link directly to more information on that item or to a biographical record of its maker.                <br><br>                For any of the three display views above, you may:                <ul>                    <li>Click the NEXT or PREVIOUS buttons to scroll through additional records in the selection.</li>                    <li>Select from the drop-down list at the top of the screen to jump to a specific position in the record set.</li>                </ul>                If multiple records were accessed through a portfolio, the portfolio name and the number of records it includes are displayed at the top of the screen.
